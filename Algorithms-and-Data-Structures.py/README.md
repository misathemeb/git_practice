# Algorithms and Data Structures

> This project was a created in tandem with learning basic algorithmic thinking and data structures that impact time and space complexity with the aid of a freeCodeCamp.org video linked in the general info section below.

## General Information

* This project was a series of three main components: algorithms, data structures and a deeper understanding of sorting and searching algorithms. The purpose of this project is two-fold: practice my Python skills while integrating programming concepts beyond the superficial syntax. By the end of the course, I was able to measure, evaluate and understand how and why data structures are used to solve complex problems.

## Technologies Used

* Python3
* VS Code

## Features

* Separate file for each concept to demonstrate problem solving

## Credits

* This course was developed by Pasan Premaratne and Jay McGavren. It was made possible by a grant from [teamtreehouse](teamtreehouse.com)

## Project Status

Project is:  _in-progress_ but will make changes if new Python update creates opportunity to refactor more efficiently.
