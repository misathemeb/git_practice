Example script for pet store
==============================

[list of itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html)

What Is This?
-------------

This is a simple Python script intended to provide a working example of using Itertools. The goal of importing the Itertool module is to demonstrate iterator algebra‚Äù is useful: improved memory efficiency (via lazy evaluation) and faster execuction time.

How To Use This
---------------

1. Install Python 3 üêç
2. Create a .py file to store code
3. import itertools before writing any logic

Testing
-------

1. To determine if an object is iterable, call iter(obj)
2. Any object that could be looped over is iterable.

Development
-----------

The options are many!

1. This could be applicable and expanded for a small restaurant with lunch combo options, a library to iterate through available books, a school roster.
2. You can even make a custom class but in order to iterate, you must implement iterator protocol by defining the methods: __iter__() & __next__() respectively
